If youâ€™re using FetchType.LAZY, you need to know about query-specific fetching. Otherwise, your application will be very slow because you created lots of n+1 select issues.

such as  two entry you use @ManyToMany and FetchType.EAGER 
then you use entry jpa to findAll() method then would
cause n+1 query sql 

so please use  FetchType.LAZY on @manyTomany
